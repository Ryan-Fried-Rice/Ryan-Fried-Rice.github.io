    <h1>Q1: Can I use freshly cooked rice to make fried rice? </h1>
    <h2>  A1: It’s not recommended. Freshly cooked rice is too moist and sticky. Day-old rice works best because it’s drier and fries better without getting mushy. </h2>
    <br>
    <h1> Q2: What kind of rice is best for fried rice?</h1>
    <h2> A2: Long-grain rice like jasmine or basmati works best. It stays fluffy and separates nicely when stir-fried. </h2>
    <br>
    <h1> Q3: Do I need a wok to make fried rice?</h1>
    <h2> A3: Nah, A large non-stick or stainless steel frying pan works just fine, just make sure it gets hot enough.</h2>
    <br>
    <h1> Q4: How do I keep fried rice from getting soggy?</h1>
    <h2> A4: Use cold, dry rice. Also, don’t overcrowd the pan, cook in batches if needed so the rice fries, not steams. </h2>
    <br>
    <h1> Q5: How long does leftover fried rice last?</h1>
    <h2> A5: In the fridge, it lasts up to 3–4 days if stored in an airtight container. Reheat it thoroughly before eating.</h2>
